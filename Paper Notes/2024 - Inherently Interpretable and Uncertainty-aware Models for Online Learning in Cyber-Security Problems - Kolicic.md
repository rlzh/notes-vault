# Summary
Propose the use of Gaussian Additive Models (GAM), specifically Additive Gaussian Processes (AGP), to provide interpretability and uncertainty-awareness to online learning problems. The authors propose a novel *rolling buffer method* to address scalability issue related to AGP-based solutions. The AGP-based approach can be used for classification or regression (classification in the paper)

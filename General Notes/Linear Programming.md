# Mixed Integer Program (MIP)
- A problem that may contain both integer and continuous variables
## Integer variables
- Variables restricted to the values 0 and 1
- Or they may take on any integer value, in which case they are referred to as *general integer variables*
## Semi-continuous variables
- Variables that may take either the value 0 or a value between a lower and an upper bound 

# Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP)
- A [[#Mixed Integer Program (MIP)|mixed integer problem]] with quadratic terms in the objective function.
	- If the model has any constraints containing a quadratic term, regardless of the objective function, the problem is termed a Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Program.

- Decision-making model which assumes players have **incomplete information**
- Players may hold private information 
- Payoffs may not be common knowledge
	- Players hold beliefs about payoff functions (beliefs are represented by probability distributions over possible payoff functions)
- Bayesian games contain set of $N$ agents, each agent $n$ must be one of a given set of type $\theta_n$

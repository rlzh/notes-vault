# Kerckhoff's Principle
- The inner workings of a cryptosystem should be/are *completely known to the adversary*
- Fundamental tenet of cryptography
- A cryptosystem is **secure** if the best-known attack requires as much work as an exhaustive key search (i.e., no shortcut attacks known)
	- Also implies for a **large key space**

# Definition
- A precise and unambiguous description of the meaning of a term
- Characterizes the meaning of an object (concept) by giving all the properties and only those properties that *must* be true
# Theorem
- Statement that is proven using rigorous mathematical reasoning
	- Often reserved for most important results
# Proposition
- A proved (interesting) result (generally less important than theorem)
# Lemma
- A subsidiary or intermediate theorem in an argument or proof
- In math, generally a minor, proven proposition used as a stepping stone to a larger result ("helping theorem")
# Corollary
- A proposition that follows from (and is often appended to) one already proved
- A theorem of less importance which can be readily deduced from a previous, more notable statement
# Conjecture
- A statement that is *unproven* but is believed to be true
# Axiom
- A statement that is assumed to be true without proof
- Basic building blocks from which all theorems are proved

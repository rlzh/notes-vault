#general #libraries
# TensorFlow
- Open-source, *symbolic math* library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks (developed by Google)
- Low-level framework 
- Scalable and production ready
# Keras
- High-level neural network API
- Can run on top of TensorFlow (and other libraries)
	- Simplifies complex TensorFlow operations
- Designed for fast experimentation with deep [[Deep Learning#Neural Networks|neural networks]]
- Better suited for plug-and-play framework to train/build models quickly
- Use cases: Image classification, NLP, recommender systems
# PyTorch
- Open-source deep learning framework (developed by Facebook)
- Offer more control over low-level details of the models
- Use cases: Computer vision, [[Reinforcement Learning]], Transfer Learning
